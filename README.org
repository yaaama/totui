* Totui

My first attempt at graphical programming in C.

It is a simple terminal user interface to manage todo lists.


* Things to do (no pun intended)

** Window boundaries
- [ ] Entering something longer than the terminal width should be checked.
  Program should calculate how many lines the new item is occupying, and then move the cursor so that it is below the new item.
- [ ] Lines that overflow the buffer should be rejected
